class Array
  # Write a method, `Array#two_sum`, that finds all pairs of positions where the
  # elements at those positions sum to zero.

  # NB: ordering matters. I want each of the pairs to be sorted smaller index
  # before bigger index. I want the array of pairs to be sorted
  # "dictionary-wise":
  #   [0, 2] before [1, 2] (smaller first elements come first)
  #   [0, 1] before [0, 2] (then smaller second elements come first)
