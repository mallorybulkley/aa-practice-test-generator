# **THIS PROBLEM WILL NOT SHOW UP ON A REAL ASSESSMENT** 
# If you are a non-native English speaker and find it difficult to understand this
# problem do not spend too much time on it and focus on other problems instead.

# Write a method that translates a sentence into pig latin. You may want a helper method.

## Rules
# In the English language, vowels are the following letters: ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] 
# Consonants are all other letters.
# Pig latin translation uses the following rules:
#  1. If the word begins with a vowel, simply append `ay` onto the end.
#      ex. 'apple' => 'appleay'
#  2. If the word begins with a consonant, move the starting consonants to the
#  end of the word and then append `ay`
#      ex1. 'pearl' => 'earlpay'
#      ex2. `school` => `oolschay`
#  3. Treat `qu` at the start of a word as a singular consonant.
#      ex1. `queen` => `eenquay`
#      ex2. `square` => `aresquay`
