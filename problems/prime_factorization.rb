# It is sometimes necessary to be able to break down a
# number into its prime factors.  The process is called 
# prime factorization.  We can use a factor tree to 
# determine the prime factorization of a number:

#                12
#              /    \
#             3      4
#                   / \
#                  2   2

# Define a method `prime_factorization(n)` that breaks a number 
# down into it's prime factors.

# example: prime_factorization(12) => [2,2,3]

def prime_factorization(num)
