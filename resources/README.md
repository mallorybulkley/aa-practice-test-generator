# Assessment 01 Instructions

**Do not share this repo or post it publicly. We will take violations very seriously.**

- We will take 45 minutes for this assessment.

- Don't worry if you can't pass every spec in the time limit; do the
  best you can.

- Instructions for each problem are included in the `practice_test.rb` file.

  - Run the specs as you solve the assessment.

  - To run the specs, run `bundle exec rspec spec.rb` from the assessment
    directory.

  - You will be evaluated based on the number of specs passed. It is in your interest to tackle easier problems first; this will help you pass specs earlier.

  - Look at the title of the spec to see why it failed; you can also
    read the spec code for more information.

  - Please ask your TAs any questions. If you get stuck or don't know why something is failing, ask. TAs will let you know whether they can answer your question, so ask anything.

  - Do not use the internet or prior notes.
