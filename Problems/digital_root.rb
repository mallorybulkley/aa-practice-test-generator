# Write a method, `digital_root(num)`. It should Sum the digits of a positive
# integer. If it is greater than 10, sum the digits of the resulting number.
# Keep repeating until there is only one digit in the result, called the
# "digital root". **Do not use string conversion within your method.**
#
# You may wish to use a helper function, `digital_root_step(num)` which performs
# one step of the process.
